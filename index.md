## Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Groups

This seminar is focusing on various research topics in arithmetic geometry with special regard to algebraic groups, homogeneous spaces and related structures or problems.

Normally, two online talks (via Zoom) are expected to be scheduled per month. The date and time of each talk will be flexibly arranged according to the speaker's convenience. 

If you want to receive annoucements of the seminar talks, please email one of the organizers.

**Title**:  *R-equivalence for group schemes*

**Abstract**:  *This is a report on a joint work with Anastasia Stavrova (St Petersburg). For  a group scheme G over a ring A, we define the R-equivalence on G(A) in a compatible way with the case of algebraic groups. We compute the invariant G(A)/R in the case of a local ring when G is a torus or G is  isotropic semisimple simply connected.*

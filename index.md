**Speaker**: Takao Yamazaki (Chuo University)

**Title**:  *Torsion birational motives of surfaces and unramified cohomology*

**Abstract**:  *Kahn-Sujatha's birational motive is a variant of Chow motive that synthesis the ideas of birational geometry and motives. We explain our result 
saying that the unramified cohomology is a universal invariant for torsion motives of surfaces. We also exhibit examples of complex varieties violating the 
integral Hodge conjecture. If time permits, we also discuss a pathology in positive characteristic. (Joint work with Kanetomo Sato.)*

**Title**:  *The Brauer-Manin obstruction for curves over global function fields*

**Abstract**:  *For a curve C over a global field k it is expected that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the existence of 
rational points and to weak approximation.*

*Over number fields this is wide open, but over global function fields there has been significant progress. Poonen and Voloch proved this for 'most'
non-isotrivial curves over global function fields over a decade ago.*

*I will discuss more recent works on this topic, joint with Voloch, in which we prove the result for all non-isotrivial curves and also give some
partial results in the isotrivial case.*

**Title**:  *Universal quadratic forms and Northcott property of infinite number fields*

**Abstract**:  *Universal quadratic forms generalize the sum of four squares about which it is well known that it represents all positive rational integers.
In the talk, I'll start by discussing some results on universal quadratic forms over totally real number fields. Then I'll move on to the - markedly 
different! - situation over infinite degree extensions K of Q. In particular, I'll show that if K doesn't have many small elements (i.e., "K has the 
Northcott property"), then it admits no universal form. The talk should be broadly accessible, and is based on a very recent joint work with Nicolas Daans
and Siu Hang Man.*

**Speaker**: Eva Bayer-Fluckiger (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)

**Title**:  *Automorphisms of K3 surfaces and cyclotomic polynomials*

**Abstract**:  *Let X be a complex projective K3 surface, and let T be its transcendental lattice; the characteristic polynomials of the isometries of T
induced by automorphisms of X are powers of  cyclotomic polynomials. Which powers of cyclotomic polynomials occur ? The aim of this note is to answer this
question, as well as related ones, and give an alternative approach to some results of Kondo, Machida, Oguiso, Vorontsov, Xiao and Zhang.*

**Title**:  *Ramified class field theory of curves over local fields*

**Abstract**:  *In this talk, I will present some results on the class field theory of smooth projective curves over a local field where one allows arbitrary
ramification along a proper closed subset. We shall derive these results using some new results on the class field theory of 2-local fields and a duality 
theorem. This is based on a joint work with Subhadip Majumder.*

**Speaker**: David Harari (Université Paris-Saclay)

**Title**:  Finiteness of certain Tate--Shafarevich sets

**Abstract**:  Let G be a smooth  algebraic group defined over a field K. The Tate--Shafarevich set of G is related to the failure of the local-global 
principle for principal homogeneous spaces of G. We discuss the finiteness of this set over various fields (number fields, p-adic function fields, function 
fields of a curve over a number field).

**Speaker**: Damián Gvirtz-Chen (University of Glasgow)

**Title**:  *Surfaces defined by pairs of polynomials*

**Abstract**:  *Surfaces in P3 defined by a pair of polynomials over a finitely generated field of characteristic zero are relevant to the study of rational 
points because their Brauer group is known to be finite up to constants. Via a topological deformation to the diagonal case we determine these Brauer 
groups provided our surface is, in an appropriate sense, sufficiently general. This generalises previous results obtained by Colliot-Thélène--Kanevsky--
Sansuc, Bright, Uematsu and Santens. (Joint work with A. N. Skorobogatov.)*

**Speaker**: Nicolas Daans (Charles University)

**Title**:  *The Pythagoras number of function fields*

**Abstract**:  *The Pythagoras number of a field K is the smallest natural number n such that every sum of squares of elements of K is a sum of n squares of 
elements of K, or infinity, if such a natural number does not exist. Let us denote the Pythagoras number of K by p(K). Any non-zero natural number (and 
infinity) is the Pythagoras number of some field. Very little is known about the behaviour of the Pythagoras number under field extensions, in particular how 
quickly and freely the Pythagoras number can grow. For example, when L/K is a finite field extension, we only in general know that p(L) is bounded by
[L : K]p(K), but in practice, we do not know of any example where p(L) > p(K) + 2 when L/K is a finite field extension. A related open question is whether, 
when p(K) is finite, then also p(K(X)) is finite, where K(X) is a rational function field over K. We also do not know of any example where p(K(X)) > p(K) + 2. 
In this talk, I discuss joint work with Karim Johannes Becher, David Grimm, Gonzalo Manzano-Flores, and Marco Zaninelli, in which we prove for an arbitrary 
field K that, if p(K(X)) = 2 (the lowest possible value), then p(L) is at most 5 for any finite field extension L of K(X), thereby providing a step in the 
direction of this open question.*

**Speaker**: Julian Lawrence Demeio (University of Basel)

**Title**:  *Weak weak approximation on Del Pezzo surfaces of low degree*

**Abstract**:  *In recent joint work with Sam Streeter and Rosa Winter, we show that weak weak approximation holds for Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 (over a number
field) with a rational point not lying on the ramification curve or on the intersection of 4 exceptional curves. To prove this, we use two geometric “procedures” to
produce rational points on the surface. The points obtained by a certain iteration of these two procedures are parametrized by a rational higher-dimensional cover of
the surface, and we deduce our result by proving the arithmetic surjectivity of the morphism defining the cover.*

**Speaker**: Mikhail Borovoi (Tel Aviv University)

**Title**:  *Galois cohomology of reductive groups over global fields*

**Abstract**:  *Let G be a connected reductive group over a global field F (a number field or a global function field). Let M=\pi_1(G) denote the “algebraic
fundamental group” of G, which is a certain finitely generated abelian group endowed with an action of the absolute Galois group Gal(F^s/F).  Using and generalizing
a result of Tate for tori, we give a closed formula for the Galois cohomology set  H^1(F,G)  in terms of the Galois module M and the Galois cohomology sets H^1(F_v,G)
for the “real” places v of F.*

*Moreover, let T be a torus  over a global field F and let M=\pi_1(T)=X_{\star}(T) denote the cocharacter group of T. We give a closed formula for H^2(F,T) in terms of
the Galois module M.*

*This is a joint work with Tasho Kaletha.*

**Title**:  *Brauer groups and Neron-Severi groups of surfaces over finite fields*

**Abstract**:  *For a smooth and proper surface over a finite field, the formula of Artin and Tate relates the behaviour of the zeta-function at $1$ to other
invariants of the surface. We give a version of the formula which equates invariants related to the Brauer group to invariants to the Neron-Severi group. To illustrate
our results we give some applications for abelian surfaces.*

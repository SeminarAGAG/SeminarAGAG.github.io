## Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Groups

This seminar is focusing on various research topics in arithmetic geometry with special regard to algebraic groups, homogeneous spaces and related structures 
or problems.

Normally, one or two online talks are expected to be scheduled per month. The date and time of each talk will be flexibly arranged according to the speaker's 
convenience. 

The online talks are usually run via **Zoom Meeting** or sometimes **Voov Meeting** (or equivalently, **Tencent meeting** in China mainland). 
Please read the [instructions](https://seminaragag.github.io/VoovInstructions.pdf) on downloading and using Voov here.

If you want to receive annoucements of the seminar talks, please email one of the organizers.

**Title**:  *Around Manin's conjecture for stacks*

**Abstract**:  *A fundamental question in Diophantine geometry is to understand the distribution of solutions to polynomial equations over the rational numbers. A 
prominent example of such a question is Manin's conjecture, which predicts the number of rational points of bounded height on certain algebraic varieties. 
Specifically, the number of rational points of height at most B is expected to be asymptotic to CB^a log(B)^b, for certain constants C,a,b. Very similar formulas 
arise in other counting problems, such as in counting of elliptic curves of bounded naive height or in Malle's conjecture, which concerns the number of Galois 
extensions of Q with bounded discriminant.*

*In this talk, we discuss a generalization of Manin's conjecture to stacks, which unifies and extends the Manin's and Malle's conjecture. We will also address the 
wild case—when the orders of automorphism groups of points of stacks are divisible by the characteristics of the global field over which the stack is defined. 
This talk is based on joint works with Takehiko Yasuda.*

**Speaker**: Boris Kunyavskii (Bar-Ilan University)

**Title**:  *Birational properties of word varieties*

**Abstract**:  *We prove that the subvariety of SL(2)xSL(2) given by the matrix equation w(X,Y)=g, where w is a word in two letters, is closely related to an 
explicit smooth conic bundle over the associated `trace surface' in the 3-dimensional affine space. When w is the commutator word, we show that this variety can 
be irrational if the ground field k is not algebraically closed, answering a question of Rapinchuk, Benyash-Krivetz, and Chernousov. When k is a number field, it 
satisfies weak approximation with the Brauer--Manin obstruction.*

*The talk is based on our joint work with Tatiana Bandman and Alexei Skorobogatov.*

**Speaker**: Tim Santens (University of Cambridge)

**Title**:  *Leading constant in Malle's conjecture*

**Abstract**:  *Let G be a finite permutation group, Malle has put forward a conjecture on the number of G-extensions of a number field of bounded discriminant. 
In this talk I will discuss recent efforts to interpret Malle's conjecture as a form of Manin's conjecture on rational points of bounded height for the stack BG. 
Based on this analogy me and Loughran have given a conjectural interpretation of the leading constant in Malle's conjecture. *

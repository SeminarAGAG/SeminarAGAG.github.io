## Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Groups

This seminar is focusing on various research topics in arithmetic geometry with special regard to algebraic groups, homogeneous spaces and related structures or problems.

Normally, two online talks (via Zoom) are expected to be scheduled per month. The date and time of each talk will be flexibly arranged according to the speaker's convenience.

**Title**:  *Surfaces defined by pairs of polynomials*

**Abstract**:  *Surfaces in P4 defined by a pair of polynomials over a finitely generated field of characteristic zero are relevant to the study of rational 
points because their Brauer group is known to be finite up to constants. Via a topological deformation to the diagonal case we determine these Brauer 
groups provided our surface is, in an appropriate sense, sufficiently general. This generalises previous results obtained by Colliot-Thélène--Kanevsky--
Sansuc, Bright, Uematsu and Santens. (Joint work with A. N. Skorobogatov.)*

**Title**:  *The Pythagoras number of function fields*

**Abstract**:  *The Pythagoras number of a field K is the smallest natural number n such that every sum of squares of elements of K is a sum of n squares of 
elements of K, or infinity, if such a natural number does not exist. Let us denote the Pythagoras number of K by p(K). Any non-zero natural number (and 
infinity) is the Pythagoras number of some field. Very little is known about the behaviour of the Pythagoras number under field extensions, in particular how 
quickly and freely the Pythagoras number can grow. For example, when L/K is a finite field extension, we only in general know that p(L) is bounded by
[L : K]p(K), but in practice, we do not know of any example where p(L) > p(K) + 2 when L/K is a finite field extension. A related open question is whether, 
when p(K) is finite, then also p(K(X)) is finite, where K(X) is a rational function field over K. We also do not know of any example where p(K(X)) > p(K) + 2. 
In this talk, I discuss joint work with Karim Johannes Becher, David Grimm, Gonzalo Manzano-Flores, and Marco Zaninelli, in which we prove for an arbitrary 
field K that, if p(K(X)) = 2 (the lowest possible value), then p(L) is at most 5 for any finite field extension L of K(X), thereby providing a step in the 
direction of this open question.*

**Title**:  *Weak weak approximation on Del Pezzo surfaces of low degree*

**Abstract**:  *In recent joint work with Sam Streeter and Rosa Winter, we show that weak weak approximation holds for Del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 (over a number
field) with a rational point not lying on the ramification curve or on the intersection of 4 exceptional curves. To prove this, we use two geometric “procedures” to
produce rational points on the surface. The points obtained by a certain iteration of these two procedures are parametrized by a rational higher-dimensional cover of
the surface, and we deduce our result by proving the arithmetic surjectivity of the morphism defining the cover.*

**Title**:  *Hasse principle over semiglobal fields*

**Abstract**:  *We review results on the  Hasse principle for homogeneous spaces under connected linear algebraic groups over function fields of curves over complete
discrete valued fields. We  present a  recent result on the Hasse principle for projective homogeneous spaces under connected reductive groups over such fields. (Joint
work with Philippe Gille.)*

**Speaker**: Mikhail Borovoi (Tel Aviv University)

**Title**:  *Galois cohomology of reductive groups over global fields*

**Abstract**:  *Let G be a connected reductive group over a global field F (a number field or a global function field). Let M=\pi_1(G) denote the “algebraic
fundamental group” of G, which is a certain finitely generated abelian group endowed with an action of the absolute Galois group Gal(F^s/F).  Using and generalizing
a result of Tate for tori, we give a closed formula for the Galois cohomology set  H^1(F,G)  in terms of the Galois module M and the Galois cohomology sets H^1(F_v,G)
for the “real” places v of F.*

*Moreover, let T be a torus  over a global field F and let M=\pi_1(T)=X_{\star}(T) denote the cocharacter group of T. We give a closed formula for H^2(F,T) in terms of
the Galois module M.*

*This is a joint work with Tasho Kaletha.*

**Title**:  *Brauer groups and Neron-Severi groups of surfaces over finite fields*

**Abstract**:  *For a smooth and proper surface over a finite field, the formula of Artin and Tate relates the behaviour of the zeta-function at $1$ to other
invariants of the surface. We give a version of the formula which equates invariants related to the Brauer group to invariants to the Neron-Severi group. To illustrate
our results we give some applications for abelian surfaces.*

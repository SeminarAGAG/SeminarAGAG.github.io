## Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Groups

This seminar is focusing on various research topics in arithmetic geometry with special regard to algebraic groups, homogeneous spaces and related structures or problems.

Normally, two online talks (via Zoom) are expected to be scheduled per month. The date and time of each talk will be flexibly arranged according to the speaker's convenience. 

If you want to receive annoucements of the seminar talks, please email one of the organizers.

**Title**:  *Bounding cohomology classes over semi-global fields*

**Abstract**:  *It is a classical problem to relate the period of a Brauer class to its index.  This has been carried out over certain ground fields, including by the
speaker and collaborators in the case of semi-global fields; i.e. function fields of curves over a complete discretely valued field.  This talk concerns an analog of
this question, in which one considers higher cohomology classes rather than Brauer classes.  Motivated by work of Saurabh Gosavi on Brauer groups, we also consider the
simultaneous index of a finite set of cohomology classes in this context.  This is joint work with Julia Hartmann and Daniel Krashen.*

**Speaker**:  Philippe Gille (Université de Lyon 1)

**Title**:  *R-equivalence for group schemes*

**Abstract**:  *This is a report on a joint work with Anastasia Stavrova (St Petersburg). For  a group scheme G over a ring A, we define the R-equivalence on G(A) in a compatible way with the case of algebraic groups. We compute the invariant G(A)/R in the case of a local ring when G is a torus or G is  isotropic semisimple simply connected.*

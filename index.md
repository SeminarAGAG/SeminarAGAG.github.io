## Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Groups

This seminar is focusing on various research topics in arithmetic geometry with special regard to algebraic groups, homogeneous spaces and related structures 
or problems.

Normally, one or two online talks are expected to be scheduled per month. The date and time of each talk will be flexibly arranged according to the speaker's 
convenience. 

The online talks are usually run via the software **Voov Meeting** (or equivalently, **Tencent meeting** in China mainland). 
Please read the [instructions](https://seminaragag.github.io/VoovInstructions.pdf) on downloading and using Voov here.

If you want to receive annoucements of the seminar talks, please email one of the organizers.

**Speaker**: Tim Santens (University of Cambridge)

**Title**:  *Leading constant in Malle's conjecture*

**Abstract**:  *Let G be a finite permutation group, Malle has put forward a conjecture on the number of G-extensions of a number field of bounded discriminant. 
In this talk I will discuss recent efforts to interpret Malle's conjecture as a form of Manin's conjecture on rational points of bounded height for the stack BG. 
Based on this analogy me and Loughran have given a conjectural interpretation of the leading constant in Malle's conjecture. *

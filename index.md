**Title**:  *Kuga-Satake construction on families of K3 surfaces of Picard rank 14*

**Abstract**:  *Classically, it is known that the period domain D of a moduli space of K3 surfaces of Picard rank r > 13 is diffeomorphic to the period 
domain of a different moduli space of some polarized varieties. The lowest Picard rank known for such a coincidence happens is r = 14: there is a 
diffeomorphism from D to the period domain of a moduli of polarized abelian 8-folds with totally definite quaternion multiplication, which descends to a map 
between the corresponding moduli spaces. We will describe the latter map explicitly by considering the Kuga-Satake construction on lattice polarized K3 
surfaces. Using lattice theoretical arguments, we will also show that the map of moduli exhibits exceptional behaviour when specialised to families of K3 
surfaces of Picard rank 18 admitting a Shioda-Inose or a Kummer structure.*

**Title**:  *Integral points on affine cubic surfaces: heuristics and numerics*

**Abstract**:  *We develop a heuristic for the number of integral solutions to cubic equations in three variables based on the circle method, predicting a 
logarithmic order of magnitude. This generalizes Heath-Browns conjecture on the number of representations k = x³ + y³ + z³ of an integer k (that is not a 
perfect cube) as a sum of three cubes.
The heuristic can be tested against asymptotic formulae by Zagier on the Markoff surface and by Baragar and Umeda on variants of it. Moreover, we obtained 
numerical data on some families of surfaces to test our heuristic against.
This is joint work with Tim Browning.*

**Title**:  *Brauer-Manin obstructions on homogeneous spaces of affine algebraic groups over global function fields*

**Abstract**:  *Given a family of varieties X over a global field k, one is interested in the sufficiency of the Brauer-Manin obstruction to explain the 
possible failure of the Hasse principle and weak/strong approximation of adelic points on X. Let G be an affine algebraic group G over k, and our family of 
interest - the principal homogeneous spaces X of G.*

*In 1981, Sansuc proved this sufficiency for connected G over a number field k by reduction to the case of a torus and an application of Poitou-Tate duality. 
Since then, arithmetic duality theorems have proven useful in the study of similar problems.*

*In this presentation, we briefly recall the significant generalization by Rosengarten of the Poitou-Tate theory to all commutative affine algebraic groups G 
over a global field k of any characteristic. Then we explain how this theory allows us to extend the stated Brauer-Manin results to (the principal 
homogeneous spaces of) all such G, not necessarily smooth or connected, highlighting the difficulties which appear in the case when k is a global function 
field.*

*This talk is based on the speaker's recent preprint, available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12127.*

**Title**:  *Terminality of moduli spaces of curves on hypersurfaces via the circle method*

**Abstract**:  *I will report on joint work with Matthew Hase-Liu that shows that the moduli space of genus g curves of degree e on a smooth hypersurface of
low degree only has terminal singularities, provided e is sufficiently large with respect to g. Using a spreading argument together with a result of Mustata, 
we reduce the problem to counting points over finite fields on the jet schemes of these moduli spaces. We solve this counting problem by developing a 
suitable version of the circle method.*

**Title**:  *On the stable birationality of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces*

**Abstract**:  *In this talk, we will address the question for which pairs of integers (n,n') the variety Hilb^n_X  is stably birational to Hilb^n'_X, when X 
is a surface with H^1(X,O_X)=0. In order to do so we will relate the existence of degree n' effective cycles on X with the existence of degree n ones using 
curves on X. 
We will then focus on geometrically rational surfaces, proving that there are only finitely many stable birational classes among the Hilb^n_X's. If time 
permits, we will see how to deduce from this the rationality of a generalization of the Hasse-Weil zeta function Z(X, t) in K_0(Var/k)/([A^1_k])[[t]] when 
char(k) = 0.*

**Title**:  *Points of bounded height on quintic del Pezzo surfaces over number fields*

**Abstract**:  *I will report on joint work with Ulrich Derenthal, where we establish Manin's conjecture for split smooth quintic del Pezzo surfaces over 
arbitrary number fields with respect to fairly general anticanonical height functions, using universal torsors. This is the first instance where Manin's 
conjecture is established over number fields different from Q for a non-toric smooth del Pezzo surface.*

**Title**:  *Manin's conjecture for Châtelet surfaces*

The key analytic ingredient is estimating sums of Fourier coefficients of modular forms along polynomial values.*

**Title**:  *Local-global principles for integral points on certain Markoff-type surfaces*

**Abstract**:  *Ghosh and Sarnak; Loughran and Mitankin; and Colliot-Thélène, Wei, and Xu have recently studied integral points on Markoff surfaces, which 
are affine cubic surfaces defined by a Diophantine equation. In this talk, inspired by these works and a recent paper of Fuchs, Litman, Silverman, and Tran, I
will present some recent results on the Brauer–Manin obstruction to local-global principles for integral points on affine Markoff-type cubic and K3 surfaces 
along with some counting results in this context.*

**Title**:  The power operation in Galois cohomology of reductive groups over number fields

**Abstract**:  Let $K$ be a number field (say, $\mathbf{Q}$) and let G be a connected reductive group over $K$ (say, SO(n)). One needs the first Galois cohomology $H^1(K,G)$ for classification problems in algebraic geometry and linear algebra over $K$.

For a number field $K$ admitting a real embedding (say, $K=\mathbf{Q}$), we show that it is impossible to define a *group structure*, functorial in $G$, on the Galois cohomology pointed set $H^1(K,G)$ for all connected reductive $K$-groups $G$.  However, over an arbitrary number field $K$, we define an *operation of raising to power n* (which we denote by $\Diamond$): $(x,n) \mapsto x^{\Diamond n}:  H^1(K,G) \times \mathbf{Z}\to H^1(K,G).$


We show that this new operation has nice functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus (hence an abelian group), the pointed set $H^1(K,G)$  has a natural  abelian group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(x,n)\mapsto x^n$.

For a cohomology class $x$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we  define the *period* (or order)  $per(x)$  to be the least integer $n>0$ such that the $n$-th power $x^{\Diamond n}=1$, and  we define the *index*  $ind(x)$  to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite extensions $L/K$ splitting $x$. We show that  $per(x)$ divides $ind(x)$, but they need not be equal. However, $per(x)$ and  $ind(x)$ have the same set of prime factors.

All terms will be defined and examples will be given. Based on a joint work with Zinovy Reichstein.

**Title**:  *Transfer principles in Galois cohomology and Serre's Conjecture II*

**Abstract**:  *Serre's Conjecture II states that if K is a field of cohomological dimension ≤ 2, G is a semisimple simply connected K-group and X is a G-torsor,
then X is trivial. This conjecture has been proved for several families of fields, and alternatively for several families of groups, but it is still open in its
full generality. The usual way of tackling this conjecture consists in "simplifying" the structure of the groups involved, proving that the torsors come from
subgroups for which the conjecture has already been proved. In joint work with Diego Izquierdo, we rather focus on "simplifying" the structure of the fields
involved. For this, we formulated certain "transfer principles", which allow us to construct fields with simpler properties, while controlling at the same time
their cohomological dimension. In this talk I will give an idea of the present situation of the conjecture and how some of these transfer principles allow us to
reduce it to the case of countable fields of characteristic 0.*

**Title**:  The Tame Approximation Problem for nonsolvable groups

**Abstract**:  Studying the arithmetic of homogeneous spaces of SL_n is a promising angle of attack to the Inverse Galois Problem and to local-global variants such as the Tame Approximation Problem. 
After giving a historical overview of this approach initiated by Emmy Noether, I will focus on recent developments on a remarkable closed subset of adelic points: the Brauer--Manin set. 
I will particularly show that the Brauer-Manin set is the closure of the set of rational points for homogeneous spaces of the form X=SL_n/G where G ranges through new families of nonsolvable groups, yielding to new positive answers to the Tame Approximation Problem. 
This is joint work with Danny Neftin.

**Title**:  *Linear algebraic groups as automorphism group schemes*

**Abstract**:  *Let F be a field, and let X/F be a projective variety. The automorphism group functor Aut(X) is represented by a group scheme, locally of finite
type over F (Grothendieck). Conversely, given an algebraic group G/F, does there exist a smooth projective variety X/F, such that Aut(X)=G? This question has a
rich history. Significant progress was recently made by several authors- especially for abelian varieties. After recalling known results, I'll explain that the 
answer to question above is positive when G is affine. This is unconditional: G may be non-smooth. One may then take X to be a suitable blow-up, at a smooth center, of a projective space. The proof features a new structure result for linear algebraic groups.*
